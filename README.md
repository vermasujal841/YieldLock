# YieldLock: Locked Yield Farming Contracts for Vesting Liquidity

## Project Description

YieldLock is a sophisticated DeFi protocol that combines yield farming with time-locked liquidity and vesting mechanisms. The platform allows users to stake LP tokens in farming pools with mandatory lock periods, where rewards are automatically vested over time to ensure long-term commitment and platform stability. This innovative approach promotes sustainable yield farming while reducing mercenary capital and encouraging genuine community participation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a more stable and sustainable yield farming ecosystem by introducing time-locked staking and vested rewards. We aim to attract long-term liquidity providers who are genuinely committed to the protocol's success, thereby reducing volatility and creating a more predictable and reliable DeFi environment for all participants.

## Key Features
